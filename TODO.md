* Config + storage
  * Different stores for 'background' stuff and 'app/frontend' stuff?
  * Encrypt storage?
  * Allow storing to GDrive or some other cloud storage/sync?
  * Probably just a JSON blob
  * store wallet start date, is_first_run,
* first run tutorial/tooltips ?
* Better blockChain management + persistent storage
  * So syncing after first startup is easier
* Build out HD Wallet
* Bloom Filters To Track/Watch for TXs from Wallet addresses
